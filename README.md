# Proposal

We propose to develop novel machine learning analyses on widely available COVID datasets to generate better and more individualized guidance for people to take the most practical and correct precautions to be safe from COVID. That is, we intend to excerpt and analyze specific data to inform people on particular actions and quantify their impact on contracting COVID. In particular, we are interested in creating quantified measurements for how much risk is mitigated by adhering to government suggested safety precautions. These precautions include wearing a mask, staying socially distant, spending time indoors rather than outdoors, and various other methods people use to reduce their COVID infection risk. We believe that current research and modeling focus too heavily on the population and community level and not enough on the individual level. By creating recommendations and quantifying individual risk assessments, we would create more meaningful utilities to extend those analyses to quantified, individual-level insights into what behaviors are most safe. 
 
We aim to implement various supervised learning algorithms to solve different tasks to develop our models. Using regression techniques, we would pull out insights from existing datasets and manipulate existing datasets to create new kinds of data points better to understand COVID movements and the infection's time-varying nature. We have found vast aggregations of safety measure data for various countries, which can be compared and analyzed for each country's COVID case data. Using each country's publicly available data, we can compare their infection rates to make personalized suggestions for people based on how effective specific precautionary measures have been in their region.

Future work on this project could be broad and exceptionally useful â€” generating actionable guidance for people to stay better safe from COVID is of interest and use to every person in the world. If our modeling turns out to be genuinely novel and useful, collecting new and better data to improve the modeling would be in the public interest. Future work could include making a platform to provide these actionable recommendations to individuals.
